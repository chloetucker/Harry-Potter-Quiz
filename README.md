## Motivation
My first dive into creating my own app from scratch, this quiz was inspired by my never ending love of the Harry Potter franchise.

## Built With
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
* 10 questions will quiz the user and match their answer to a store of correct answers.
* User will get corresponding feedback for each answer, whether correct or incorrect.
* User will ultimately earn enough points to defeat the Dark Lord ( >= 8 ), or be defeated ( < 8 ).
* User has option to start the quiz over and make another attempt. 

## Struggles 
* One of the biggest hurdles I hit in this project was trying to figure out how to match the user selected answer to the answer in the store. With only about a month of JavaScript under my belt at the time, this became a massive undertaking, and a huge victory when I conquered it. Finding the solution involved a lot of googling, trial and error, and many many console logs for each tiny step of the process.
* This project was my first big dance with CSS, and as such, I struggled with getting items to line up, center, and generally go where I want them to. I love working with CSS because you can immediately see the outcome of what you've just attempted, and ultimately I was able to get things in line.
